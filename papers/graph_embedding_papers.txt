        TLDR:   Representation learning in heterogeneous networks faces challenges due to heterogeneous structural information of multiple types of 
                nodes and relations, and also due to the unstructured attribute or content (e.д.,text) associated with some types of nodes. 
                While many recent works have studied homogeneous, heterogeneous, and attributed networks embedding, there are few works that have 
                collectively solved these challenges in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we address them by developing a Semanticaware Heterogeneous 
                Network Embedding model (SHNE).SHNE performs joint optimization of heterogeneous SkipGram and deep semantic encoding for capturing both 
                heterogeneous structural closeness and unstructured semantic relations among all nodes, as function of node content, that exist in the network.
                Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHNE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various heterogeneous network mining tasks, such as link 
                prediction, document retrieval, node recommendation, relevance search, and class visualization.

2. HGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network

        TLDR:   Representation learning in heterogeneous graphs aims to pursue a meaningful vector representation for each node so as to facilitate downstream 
                applications such as link prediction, personalized recommendation, node classification, etc. text or image) associated with each node.
                Despite a substantial amount of effort has been made to homogeneous (or heterogeneous) graph embedding, attributed graph embedding as well as 
                graph neural networks, few of them can jointly consider heterogeneous structural (graph) information as well as heterogeneous contents 
                information of each node effectively. In this paper, we propose HetGNN, a heterogeneous graph neural network model, to resolve this issue. 
                Next, we design a neural network architecture with two modules to aggregate feature information of those sampled neighboring nodes. The first 
                module encodes “deep” feature interactions of heterogeneous contents and generates content embedding for each node.

3. TaPEm: Task-Guided Pair Embedding in Heterogeneous Network ( may not be  relevant )

        Link:   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01546.pdf
        TLDR:   Many real-world tasks solved by heterogeneous network embedding methods can be cast as modeling the likelihood of a pairwise relationship 
                between two nodes. For example, the goal of author identification task is to model the likelihood of a paper being written by an author 
                (paper–author pairwise relationship). However, we claim that for task-guided embeddings, it is crucial to focus on directly modeling the 
                pairwise relationship.To this end, we 1) propose to learn a pair embedding under the guidance of its associated context path, i.e., a sequence 
                of nodes between the pair, and 2) devise the pair validity classifier to distinguish whether the pair is valid with respect to the specific 
                task at hand. Extensive experiments on author identification task demonstrate that TaPEm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially 
                for authors with few publication records.

4. GATNE: Representation Learning for Attributed Multiplex Heterogeneous Network

        Link:   https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01669.pdf
        TLDR:   Network embedding (or graph embedding) has been widely used in many real-world applications. However, existing methods mainly focus on 
                networks with single-typed nodes/edges and cannot scale well to handle large networks. The framework supports both transductive and inductive 
                learning. We also give the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework, showing its connection with previous works and proving its better 
                expressiveness. We conduct systematical evaluations for the proposed framework on four different genres of challenging datasets: Amazon, 
                YouTube, Twitter, and Alibaba1 .
